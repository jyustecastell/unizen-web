## **Tournament Details**

**The ZEN Smart Score™(ZSS)**, is a custom dataset of aggregated LunarCrush powered social sentiment data. **It is the combined metric of ZTI and ZSI**.

**The ZEN Twitter Indicator™(ZTI)** is a quantitative aggregate of twitter activity over a selected digital asset(*aggregate of number of tweets, quoted retweets, retweets, replies and favorites*)

**The ZEN Sentiment Indicator™(ZSI)** score, is an *aggregate of “bullish” sentiment around a digital asset*, on twitter( using LunarCrush powered deep learning algos)

1. **Tweet Recognition :** LunarCrush recognizes a coin by AssetID. For a post including the ticker ($ZCX) or tag ([@zencexofficial](http://twitter.com/zencexofficial)) but with non-related description (like how $QNT is so bullish) will be counted under ZTI automatically.\
   Tweets with $ticker, [@Tag](http://twitter.com/Tag) , name of coin and related description will be checked for bullishness under ZSI.
2. **Number of followers is not a criteria**. We are creating our custom indicator because their social engagement score is skewed towards number of followers
3. **On Bot-rigging:** Even in the previous rounds, we requested proofs but nobody could prove it. Polls were randomised in such a way that nobody could purchase bots in such a short span of time. Imagine paying money to sites that don’t even have SSL certificates lol.

If someone comes up with “bots are automatically posting bullish tweets to increase the ZSI for the competitor”, No explanations will be given.

To further decorate the competition, we would request the community members of semifinalists to use **\#TournamentofAlts hashtag**.

It won’t affect the results but the top rated tweets will end up on LunarCrush dashboard. We will post those curated tweets on **t.me/zensmartfeed**.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Poll has begun but there is no data/ refresh ?**\
It updates hourly.\
**2. Are there any hidden parameters?**\
All the metrics are listed on site. The poll is as transparent as possible without compromising LunarCrush’s IPR.\
**3. ”My team is losing, what can i do ?”**\
You can increase the ZTI by posting more tweets and ZSI by improving the “bullishness” of the shill.\
**4. ”I checked the community chats, they are not talking about the competition but still in lead, how is that possible?”**\
Note: this is no longer a competition of one community ( say 18000 members/followers ) vs another ( say 3000).\
There is only one platform (Twitter) and the overall popularity of that coin on twitter will decide the game. Every twitter user is a participant.\
**5. My coin has better score of galaxy rank and alt rank but it is still losing, why?**\
G&A scores are not the deciding factor of the competition. Disclosing why /how Zen indicators are different will compromise their IPR.
