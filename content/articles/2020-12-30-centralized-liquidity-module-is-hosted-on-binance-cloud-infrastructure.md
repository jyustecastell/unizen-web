ZEN centralized liquidity module is built on the Binance Cloud ecosystem to ensure optimal performance, with a highly responsive User Interface (UI) that has been extensively stress-tested to ensure it can withstand
bandwidth exertion. This ties into the high liquidity that ZEN will provide, as it will have unlimited access to shared trading liquidity and depth with Binance.

In addition to the above, the novel exchange will be equipped with Binanceâ€™s leading security measures that have withstood countless malicious attempts over the years, providing users peace of mind as they buy, sell, and hold tokens on ZEN.
