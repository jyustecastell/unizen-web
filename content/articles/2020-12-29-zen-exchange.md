**The Zen Cryptocurrency Exchange** (ZenCEX), which is set to launch in Q1 of 2021, offers an intelligently designed market ecosystem -- with a comprehensive focus on an exuberance of  liquidity paired with proven AI-driven trade indicators.

Simply put, ZenCEX is the only solution that aggregates all of the favorable elements within the digital asset economy, onto a single dashboard. By leveraging Binance’s Cloud infrastructure, the ZenCEX platform is enabled to uphold and meet high liquidity and user demand, optimizing the user experience. The trading framework is built in a multi-chain structure; as such, deep liquidity is pooled from first-rate sources (centralized and decentralized). This eliminates the need for utilizing disjointed, alternative solutions -- which consequently result in numerous fees and time gaps between trades as users transfer tokens, ultimately affecting their profitability. Social sentiment indicators driven by AI learning, enhance the trading experience for users in search of both traditional and emergent cryptocurrency listings. ZenCex also houses an incubator, the ZenX Incubator. It aims to discover, accelerate and deliver the next generation of digital assets exclusively to Zen Exchange. ZCX, the native token to ZenCEX, will unlock decentralized governance and utility, ensuring that integrity, transparency, and veracity are the foundation it builds on. 

ZenCEX offers Tier-One regulatory compliance, expedited listing, competitive listing costs, minimal trading fees and extensive liquidity -- with a wide-range of trading products.

**A Binance Cloud Product**\
ZenCEX is built on the Binance Cloud ecosystem to ensure optimal performance, with a highly responsive User Interface (UI) that has been extensively stress-tested to ensure it can withstand bandwidth exertion. This ties into the high liquidity that ZenCEX will provide via Binance, as it will have unlimited access to shared trading liquidity and depth with Binance. In addition to the above, the novel exchange will be equipped with Binance’s leading security measures that have withstood countless malicious attempts over the years, providing users peace of mind as they buy, sell, and hold tokens on ZenCEX.

**Novel Liquidity Standard**\
As previously mentioned, liquidity is a top priority for the Zen team, accordingly, the roadmap is brimmed with milestones to achieve the most comprehensive liquidity in the market. Upon launch, the Zen exchange will share its liquidity pool with that of Binance for its most essential pairs to maximize the user experience. Moreover, projects gearing up to be listed on ZenCEX must adhere to high liquidity requirements. As such, ZenCEX is well-equipped to tap into a vast pool of centralized trading volume, in addition to leveraging the shifting tide towards decentralized liquidity. The product roadmap will introduce cross-chain alternatives and host liquidity from multiple decentralized sources, directly integrated with the rich ecosystem of ZenCEX. All future integrations will be addressed with ease-of-use in mind, by providing a plethora of liquidity to ensure unlimited access to tokens. Having an ecosystem with trading products from various liquidity providers reduces the necessity of our users to move funds between exchanges -- maximizing users purchasing power on time-sensitive transactions, reducing the risk of lost or misplaced funds, and minimizing transaction fees as funds are allocated between multiple, disjointed platforms. 

**Social Sentiment Indicators**\
Zen has partnered with [LunarCRUSH](https://lunarcrush.com/markets) to provide real-time social sentiment data that is parsed through machine learning. This platform uses intelligent, predictive models to provide highly accurate indicators that impact the market. ZenCEX will be the first exchange to completely leverage these tools and integrate them seamlessly into the infrastructure. Users will have access to timely and accurate sentiment indicators at all times and with the relevant context. This will eliminate the time consuming burden of staying updated around the clock, across all social channels. Real-time social sentiment intelligence is something that users will find to be extremely useful, and it is a great example of how the Zen team is expanding users capabilities, as they are empowered to initiate well-informed trades while taking advantage of the smart exchange ecosystem. Upon its launch, the ZenCEX aims to become a staple in the cryptocurrency ecosystem at large and home to a variety of emerging projects and initiatives ranging from exchange services, blockchain protocols and charity work, to a pillar in the venture incubator space via ZenX. The Zen team is well equipped to gain momentum and tackle the constant dance of regulatory arbitrage as the exchange extends and launches services in jurisdictions across the world. 

**ZenX Incubator** \
In addition to the exchange, the team has set the foundation for an innovation incubator, unlike any other in the cryptosphere. This collaborative push will enable novel projects and junior teams to leverage the marketing and network leverage of the Zen team, alongside [JUN Capital](https://www.juncapital.io/) -- as they concieve, develop and guide breakthrough projects in the earliest stages of their technical development. The overarching goal of ZenX is to help each cohort get further along with clear guidelines on the overall mission, market positioning and actionable go-to-market strategies for each product segment. The Zen team provides the necessary foundational structure and access to its pool of accredited investors, therefore, founders can remain efficient as they allocate provided resources to building their ecosystem. In order to achieve a successful project launch and to accelerate the adoption thereafter, the ZenX members act as facilitators, providing a network that surfaces and responds to the unique needs of each startup, through a network of seasoned advisors. 

**ZCX Token Utility**\
ZCX is an exchange-based utility token, created on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token. Zen operates within the Binance Cloud ecosystem, and the functionality of ZCX is analogous to that of [Binance Coin (BNB)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/) on the Binance exchange. 

**\-Token Burn & Vault**\
The ZCX token is bought at market value and burnt with a percentage of profits at ongoing intervals throughout the year, as well as with every paid listing. Listing fees will partially be paid in ZCX and 50% of listing fees collected will be distributed into the following allocations: insurance fund, staking pool, charitable contributions and a certain percentage of tokens will be subject to a token burn. In addition to the above, ZCX is bought and vaulted with a percentage of accrued income throughout the year. These vaults are balanced with burn operations to ensure the team can continue to lock large percentages of the circulating supply out of the market.

\-**Collaborative Governance**\
The Zen team empowers its decentralized community to make key decisions that directly impact the exchange, including but not limited to listing votes for pre-identified candidates, contributing to the roadmap and inclusion on factoring changes made to the ZenCEX User Interface (UI).

**\-Reducing Trading Fees**\
ZCX can be used to reduce transaction fees on ZenCex. Fees will automatically be deducted from users' ZCX holdings if they hold it in their exchange wallet. This will lend itself to great trading discounts on the ZenCEX trading platform. 

**\-Dynamic Profit Sharing**\
Users that decide to stake their ZCX tokens will be rewarded in accordance to the net profits of the Zen exchange. The share distribution will depend on a number of factors, such as the period of time token holders agree to lock their ZCX as well as the number of tokens that are staked. 

**\-Direct Access to Angel Investment Incubators**\
ZCX token holders that take advantage of the staking feature are automatically registered to earn tickets, which grant them admission to participate in seed-round investment opportunities by way of Zen-incubated projects, along with ZenX-native initial exchange offerings (IEOs).
