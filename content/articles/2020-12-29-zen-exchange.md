**The Zen Cryptocurrency Exchange**, which is set to launch in Q1 of 2021, offers an intelligently designed market ecosystem -- with a comprehensive focus on an exuberance of liquidity paired with proven AI-driven trade indicators.

Simply put, ZEN Exchange is the only solution that aggregates all of the favorable elements within the digital asset economy, onto a single dashboard. By leveraging Binance’s Cloud infrastructure, the ZenCEX platform is enabled to uphold and meet high liquidity and user demand, optimizing the user experience. The trading framework is built in a multi-chain structure; as such, deep liquidity is pooled from first-rate sources (centralized and decentralized). This eliminates the need for utilizing disjointed, alternative solutions -- which consequently result in numerous fees and time gaps between trades as users transfer tokens, ultimately affecting their profitability. Social sentiment indicators driven by AI learning, enhance the trading experience for users in search of both traditional and emergent cryptocurrency listings. ZenCex also houses an incubator, the ZenX Incubator. It aims to discover, accelerate and deliver the next generation of digital assets exclusively to Zen Exchange. ZCX, the native token to ZenCEX, will unlock decentralized governance and utility, ensuring that integrity, transparency, and veracity are the foundation it builds on. 

ZenCEX offers Tier-One regulatory compliance, expedited listing, competitive listing costs, minimal trading fees and extensive liquidity -- with a wide-range of trading products.
